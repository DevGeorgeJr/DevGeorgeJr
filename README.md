**`Software Engineer`**

I'm a full-stack developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. I have designed and developed software applications ranging from restaurant systems, human resource systems, real estate systems, and warehouse management systems. Although I have years of experience in web development, I am still hungry for learning and continue to sharpen my skills.
